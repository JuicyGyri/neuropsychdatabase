# Neuropsych Database
Repository for REDCap database structure and materials to construct a Clinical Neuropsychology Assessment Database. 

You can find the XML structure for REDCap (upload and go); and the data dictionary. 

I will update the available documents into subsections, and make it more modular over time for convenience in constructing your own version of a neuropsychology REDCap database.
